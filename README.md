# Final-Project
## Assessment 
#### Self-Assessment
We really had to push for the group to figure out the model we were going to use.  This took us awhile as we had to find the dataset to see what kind of model were going to use.  The job data was taking a little while, due to web scraping, so when the model was finally figured out it was late in the game.  We had to quickly merge the data work with what we had.  But we pulled together and figured it out. <br>
#### Contributions To the Final Project
•	Assisted in selecting the dataset and mapping out the merges.<br>
•	Assisted in preprocessing the dataset in preparation for machine learning models<br>
•	Contributed code to machine learning models<br>
•	Contributed Content to the ReadMe<br>

- Working with branches in Git hub was interesting and something that I will need to improve on. I have no background in coding or computer language and it was difficult to adjust.  I will resume classes in the fall, with courses focused on analytics, statistics, and anything else that I can add to get a stronger understanding of the tools that I have obtained.<br>  
- I overcame by working harder.  To overcome, I studied longer.  I read things over and over until it made sense.  I googled everything and found stack overflow extremely helpful at times when  I could understand it.  The readings and the videos were extremely helpful and if I worked hard enough, it made just enough sense for me to complete the challenge and understand it.  I am in no way any kind of an expert in this, but it is a great start for the direction I want to go in. <br>

### Team Assessment

#### Communication Protocols
One weekly meeting outside of class was scheduled.  Our primary form of communication was through Slack.  Everyone had what they were working on for the project.  When class time or the weekly meeting came, we brought what we had and sorted out any problems we were having.  Some people had to do multiple jobs in the group and people just stepped up and filled in where necessary. If I could do one thing different, it would be to schedule more time together as a group.

#### Summary of the Final Project
Would you like to see the economics of the location of a job that you are interested in?  A logistics regression machine learning model highlighting the cost-of-living index, median income index, and unemployment index, could make it easier to find the perfect data analyst job.
